#The Biophysical Indicator of Susceptibility to Drought

The Biophysical Indicator of Susceptibility to Drought is a geographic map
representing the susceptibility to desertification of the covered areas with a range
between 0 and 1. The higher values correspond to places whose history indicates a
dynamic drift towards the advancement of desertification processes.

This indicator is comprised of two fundamental components:

Climate
- Static component, which refers to the mean number of droughts over a period of 20 years.
- Dynamic component, which refers to the trend of droughts over a 10
years period.

Biophysical Factors
- Vegetation, which refers to the relative status of the vegetation in specific Land Cover classes.
- Soil, which refers to the relative status of the soil in specific Land Cover classes.

The intermediate indicators: 
-  Local static degradation [CS(x)] 
-  Local dynamic degradation [CD(x)] 
-  Local vegetation status [V(x)]
-  Local soil status [S(x)]
-  Vegetation and Soil status [B(x)]

The ISD is F(CD(x), CS(X) and B(x)) and it is classified as follows:
-  Low Susceptibility (0 to 0.64)
-  Medium Susceptibility (0.64 to 0.74)
-  High Susceptibility (0.74 to 1)
