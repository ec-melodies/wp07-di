The Indicator of Susceptibility to Desertification (ISD) is a geographic map
representing the susceptibility to desertification of the covered areas with a range
between 0 and 1. The higher values correspond to places whose history indicates a
dynamic drift towards the advancement of desertification processes.

This indicator is comprised of two fundamental components:

Climate
o Static component, which refers to the mean number of droughts over a period of 20 years.
o Dynamic component, which refers to the trend of droughts over a 10
years period.

Biophysical Factors
o Vegetation, which refers to the relative status of the vegetation in specific Land Cover classes.
o Soil, which refers to the relative status of the soil in specific Land Cover classes.

The intermediate indicators: 
a) Local static draught degradation [CS(x)] (mean value of RL1)
b) Local dynamic draught degradation [CD(x)] (trend of RL1)
c) Local vegetation status [V(x)]
d) Local soil status [S(x)]
e) Vegetation and Soil status [B(x)]

The ISD is F(CD(x), CS(X) and B(x)) and it is classified as follows:
1. Low Susceptibility (0 to 0.64)
2. Medium Susceptibility (0.64 to 0.74)
3. High Susceptibility (0.74 to 1)
